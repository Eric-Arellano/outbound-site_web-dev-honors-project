                <h3>The Closet Problem</h3>
                <p>At least 500 thousand youth are still in the closet, in the U.S. alone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Closet often feels confusing, lonely, and scary</li>
                    <li>One in three LGBTQ youth don't have an adult they can trust</li>
                    <li>Allies often can't relate to the actual experience of coming out</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Our Solution: Connection</h3>
                <p><a href="find-a-mentor.html">Connect with a mentor</a> who has been through a similar experience. Ask them questions,
                    learn from their story, find another ally.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Matched for relevance to your interests, obstacles, and situation</li>
                    <li>Safe and confidential online communication</li>
