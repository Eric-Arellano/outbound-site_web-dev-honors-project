# OutBound Website

## Final Project - Web Development Course
I created this [site](www.getoutbound.org) from scratch for my Final Honors Project for CIS 300 Web Development and Design.

It uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES5).

### About OutBound
I had started OutBound my junior year of high school as an online resource to help LGBTQ students leaving the closet by connecting them with personalized mentors.

At the time I had created the site using Squarespace, so my project was to rewrite the site on my own.

## Design / Programming Approach
This project is my first time ever creating a website! Nevertheless, I tried to follow best practices.

In particular, I tried to follow [Object Oriented CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/) and the BEM naming style. I used this [style guide](http://cssguidelin.es) focused on "sane" and "maintainable" CSS.

I also aimed to make a responsive site and follow HTML5 best practices.

## Issues

#### No backend
Backend server support was outside the scope of this project, so the registration forms currently don't actually do anything after submission.

#### Sometimes awkward UI
Because the point of this project was to learn, I focused on doing things from scratch rather than just copying code from others. So, some things like the responsive mobile menu are fairly awkward to use.

#### Still slow to load
Even with taking steps like compressing images and enabling GZIP compression, this site is still relatively slow to load.

## What I learned
While I've authored sites before, this was my first time ever *coding* a functional web site.

* HTML5 elements and best practices
* Object oriented CSS and BEM naming style
* Responsive web development
* JavaScript and jQuery
* Speed optimization / compression
* Git
