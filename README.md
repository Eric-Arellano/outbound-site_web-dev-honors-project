# OutBound Website

## Final Project - Web Development Course
I created this site from scratch for my Final Honors Project for CIS 300 Web Development 
and Design. It uses HTML5, CSS3, and for my Honors Project JavaScript.

### About OutBound
I had started OutBound my junior year of high school as an online resource to help LGBTQ 
students leaving the closet by connecting them with personalized mentors.

At the time I created the site using Squarespace, so my project was to rewrite the site
on my own.

## Design / Programming Approach
This project is my first time ever creating a website! Nevertheless, I tried to follow 
best practices.

In particular, I tried to follow 
[Object Oriented CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/) 
and the BEM naming style. I used this [style guide](http://cssguidelin.es) focused on 
"sane" and "maintainable" CSS.

I also aimed to make a responsive site and follow HTML5 best practices.
