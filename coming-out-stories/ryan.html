            <p>Hey! My name is Ryan, and I hail from the great city of
                Washington, D.C. I am a University student, working towards my
                degree in Counseling Psychology. I have 2 cats and enjoy
                playing video games and reading numerous types of books.
            </p>

            <p>Coming out took a while for me. Growing up in a Christian home,
                I almost hadn’t even heard about gay people, let alone
                understood what my own feelings were. I finally realized I was
                gay when I was 15. I had a friend at the time that I was
                convinced was my “best friend.” I wanted to do everything with
                and for this person because I thought that is what best friends
                did. When he got a girlfriend, though, I became exceptionally
                jealous, but I couldn’t understand why. Shouldn’t I have been
                happy for him? Regardless, I soon began to realize that the
                reason I was so upset was because I had a crush on him.
            </p>



            <p>I didn’t come to terms with that until I told my actual best
                friend (a female) that I was gay. I told her on April Fools day
                so I could back out if I needed to. She was wonderful, though,
                and helped me accept who I was. The path to telling my family
                was difficult. My dad is a chaplain (pastor) in the Air Force,
                so there are still issues there. For the most part, though, the
                people have accepted me, and now that I am older I feel
                comfortable with being who I am.
            </p>

            <p> I am a student. I love movies. I love food. I love video games.
                I love reading. I love theater.  Being gay is a part of who I
                am, but it hasn’t changed me. It doesn’t entirely define me,
                yet it adds a richness to other factors of my life, just as any
                person would say. You don’t have to fit into a mold to be
                considered gay or straight. Just be you, and doing so is what
                will bring true happiness.
            </p>

            <p>Cheers!</p>
