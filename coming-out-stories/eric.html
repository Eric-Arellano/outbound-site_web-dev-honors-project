            </aside> -->


            <p>I grew up disliking gay people, so I was in for quite the
                journey towards accepting myself as gay. My name's Eric, and
                I'm a junior in high school in Tucson, Arizona. I started
                OutBound because of the experiences I went through, and have
                since been excited to help people figure out their identity and
                come out of the closet. Outside of OutBound and school, I'm a
                big time fan of video games, alternative-ish music, and the
                Colbert Report.
            </p>

            <p>I grew up in a conservative, religious family in the Bay Area.
                I was out with my mom in 2008 trying to stop California's
                marriage equality by going door-to-door for Yes on Prop 8. Now
                outside of frustrating unacceptance towards the LGBTQ community,
                my family was pretty great and loving. But still, this stance
                made it difficult for me to accept my sexual orientation
                sophomore year of high school.
            </p>



            <p>After ignoring my sexuality during middle school and freshman
                year, I ended up finally dealing with it in 2012 as more of my
                friends began to date. I at first was embarrassed and scared,
                but I eventually realized my orientation was just one factor of
                who I am.
            </p>

            <p>I wasn't comfortable telling others, but I soon told one of my
                closest friends to try to find support. With a great response
                from her, I moved on to telling my parents, knowing that the
                response wouldn't be pretty. My parents were mostly concerned
                that I was confused and in a stage, and in response encouraged
                me to "talk to experts." I was scared this would put me back in
                the closet, after finally finding some self-acceptance, so I
                naturally resisted anything but acceptance of how I identify.
                My parents meant to protect me from what they saw as a
                difficult life from persecution for being gay, but in the
                process I felt rejected. My older brothers, too, were very
                uncomfortable with my orientation.
            </p>

            <p>Fortunately, the cliche "it gets better" really is true. While
                my family was gradually becoming more comfortable, I began to
                tell more of my friends and peers. Even my group of guy friends
                who occasionally made gay jokes was very empathetic and
                accepting. They acted like nothing really changed, what I was
                hoping for. By junior year of high school, my family had nearly
                reached acceptance. Things still aren't entirely perfect, but
                we once again trust and love each other. After moving from the
                Bay Area to Tucson, Arizona this past summer, I've been happy
                to find support among my peers for living honestly.
            </p>

            <p>There were some ups and downs, but I am incredibly grateful that
                I now not only found acceptance for gay people but that
                identify as gay.
            </p>
