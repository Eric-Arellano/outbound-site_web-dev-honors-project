            <p>My name is Jamie Kerwin and I live in Juno, Alaska. I am a
                full-time AmeriCorps volunteer serving at the LGBTQ non-profit
                organization, Identity. I am Identity’s youth engagement
                specialist, and I work with all of our youth programs. I am
                very passionate about improving the social and emotional lives
                of LGBTQ youth and young adults. I want LGBTQ youth to be able
                to have experiences that were different from my own.
            </p>

            <p>I grew up in an extremely strict and religious household. My
                family belonged to the Church of Christ, which is a very
                unaccepting Christian denomination. We went to church, rain or
                shine, three times a week. Honestly, I didn’t even know what
                being gay meant until I was 12. I started to comprehend it more
                as I aged and approached high school, but I never heard
                positive messages about being gay. As the gay rights movement
                began to expand and marriage equality became a more relevant
                political issue, I would frequently hear negative messages
                concerning marriage equality in the Sunday sermon. When I was
                16, I asked my mom what she would do if I came out as gay. She
                told me she would kick me out of the house. Of course, I don’t
                think she would have actually done this. However, I do believe
                that she would have sent me to reparative therapy. I didn’t
                realize my feelings towards women were real until college. I
                didn’t have a framework for understanding these feelings until
                I started to become a more open-minded individual.
            </p>



            <p>Accepting myself was a hard process. I had a lot of internalized
                homophobic attitudes that I am ashamed of today. I always stood
                up for gay rights, but I never realized how homophobic I
                actually was until I began questioning my sexuality at the age
                of 19. I slowly came out as bisexual/pansexual to a lot of my
                inner circles. Most people took the message with shock or
                seemed uncomfortable by it. Even my best friend, who was gay,
                told me that he didn’t believe in bisexuality. Instead of
                supporting me in my confusion, he made me feel worse. Needless
                to say, it took a while before I could sort out the people who
                really supported me. My sister was the only member of my direct
                family who has always been supportive throughout this whole
                process. Coming out to my mom was very difficult. She is still
                not supportive of my sexuality, so we have a very limited
                relationship. It was hard to accept myself when I was
                constantly being told my soul was in jeopardy, so I have
                isolated myself from her. I was never able to come out to my
                dad, who died this past November. It is a regret of mine.
            </p>

            <p>Although my coming out process was very difficult, things are
                much better for me now. I currently identify as a lesbian in my
                work circles and queer in my youth circles. I am also a
                feminist. Personally, I think the process of unacceptance has
                been a positive factor in my life. It has exposed the people in
                my life who truly matter and support me as an individual. A lot
                of people in my life who I did not expect to accept me have
                stepped forward and extended their support. Accepting yourself
                and coming out is a lifelong process. I’m proud of myself for
                having the courage to take control of my life. I love being gay!
