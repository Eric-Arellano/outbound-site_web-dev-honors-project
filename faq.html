                <dl>

                    <dt>What do mentors do?</dt>
                    <dd>Mentors volunteer to help you figure out your identity and
                        potentially come out of the closet. In addition to providing
                        a listening ear, they draw from their own experiences to
                        relate to and address what you would like to discuss.</dd>

                    <dt>How am I matched to a mentor?</dt>
                    <dd>We make sure mentors share your potential experiences and
                        interests by comparing their questionnaire responses and
                        comments to yours. We will try to give you a choice of
                        two mentors to connect with when possible.</dd>

                    <dt>Who can find a mentor?</dt>
                    <dd><em>Nearly anyone.</em> We started OutBound to make sure
                        that people can connect with someone who has been through
                        their situation regardless of where they live in the United
                        States or their situation (age, gender, religion, sexual
                        orientation, etc.) However, we are not at this time able to
                        support people 1) under 13 years old, 2) from outside of
                        the United States, or 3) at a high risk for suicide,
                        violence, chronic mental illness, etc. In these situations,
                        we recommend several, more appropriate resources.</dd>

                    <dt>How do I communicate with my mentor?</dt>
                    <dd>All communication takes place through a convenient and
                        secure online instant messaging platform called
                        <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>. The platform is
                        easily accessed through a web app, email integration,
                        and mobile apps.</dd>

                    <dt>Is this safe?</dt>
                    <dd>We make sure you're always safe by carefully screening
                        mentors (including conducting mentor background checks and
                        relevant training) before we ask if you would like to
                        connect with them. We also monitor communications to make
                        sure both you and the mentor are comfortable and safe; but
                        don't worry, we'll never butt in!</dd>

                    <dt>Is this anonymous/private?</dt>
                    <dd>We understand privacy is important, so adapt to what works
                        best for you. Some are comfortable with communicating
                        through Facebook messages, whereas others create new email
                        accounts for OutBound. We will always respect your privacy.
                        Furthermore, questionnaire responses and communications
                        with a mentor are never seen by anyone but an admin.</dd>

                <dl>

                    <dt>What are the responsibilities?</dt>
                    <dd>Mentors volunteer to help people figure out their identity
                        and gradually come out of the closet by drawing from the
                        experiences that they went through. Mentors are not meant
                        to serve as therapists, but to address any potential
                        concerns of the mentee and to provide a sympathetic
                        listening ear.</dd>

                    <dt>What is the time commitment?</dt>
                    <dd>We encourage mentors to communicate with their mentees
                        weekly, while adapting to a higher or lower frequency as
                        needed. We also check up on mentors for a few minutes
                        through Skype every two to four weeks.</dd>

                    <dt>What happens when I am matched with a mentee?</dt>
                    <dd>By signing up as a mentor, you agree to connect with a
                        mentee when your situations and experiences are relevant.
                        We will let you know when you are a potential match, then
                        let you know if the mentee would like to connect. From
                        there, we will provide a Skype training session and
                        introduce you to the mentee.</dd>

                    <dt>Who can become a mentor?</dt>
                    <dd>Anyone who has left the closet and would like to help
                        others in a similar situation is encouraged to
                        <a href="become-a-mentor.html">sign up as a mentor</a>.
                        Mentors should show maturity and empathy. Please note, we
                        conduct background checks to ensure the safety of our
                        mentees. Although we currently only work in the United
                        States, we encourage international people to sign up as
                        potential mentors for the future when we expand.</dd>

                    <dt>How will I be supported?</dt>
                    <dd>We begin each mentorship with a Skype training session.
                        Additionally, we check up for a few minutes every two to
                        four weeks on Skype to make sure that you feel comfortable
                        and prepared. We encourage mentors to reach out to us if
                        they are ever looking for further support.</dd>
